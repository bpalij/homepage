              Already have a barchelor`s degree, curently studying for master`s degree.
              Was initially interested in front-end development, have experience with Bootstrap, jQuery, Angular 1. 
              Now I would like to learn to write good code and have experience in full-stack JS development with 
              Node.js, React, other essential tools, like Babel, Webpack, etc. 
              Looking for enviroment, where I can gain good experience and good coding/development practices and skills.

                <h3 class="yellow-header mar5px mar-bot10px ">My story of learning to program</h3>
                <p class="justify">
                    My first programming was on Delphi in school, but I do not think this is programming, 
                    because we were taught just to type code from the textbook. 
                    In the university the first programming language was Turbo Pascal. 
                    It is not realy relevant, I did not really like it, 
                    but it gave me understanding of some core programming concepts, like variables, their types,
                    for, while and do-while loops, and so on. 
                    Later we were taught C++ (despite the course was named "Object-oriented programming", there was no OOP) 
                    and I was really excited with its syntax and automatic data type converting while assigning some data to variable of another type.
                    Later on there was Assembler (which was really interesting), 
                    Java (it was not taught, my friend learnt it, so I also learnt something, understood and used OOP at the first time. I still think pure OOP implementation in Java is one of the best, but, in my opininon, it is sometimes more comfortable and easy to use structural\imperative programing, may be in addition to OOP) 
                    C# (feels similar to Visual C++ and Java), SQL, even later - HTML\CSS, LESS, PHP. 
                    But I did not like desktop programming, because I understood, 
                    that common user will not use console programms, and did not such tools, like WinForms and Spring, 
                    because moving elements in Visual Studio did not give real knowledge of WinForms, so I did not feel confident, 
                    Spring felt overcomplicated. When I bacame familiar with HTML+CSS+JS, I really liked it, 
                    because it was close to real-world apps, not just some code running in the IDE, 
                    JS was a multi-paradigm language with automatic data type management, 
                    and it is, probably, one of the easiest and comfortable way of creating GUI. 
                    Some problems are that it is difficult or impossible to implement DRY principle in CSS 
                    (preprocessors may help, but it is not really comfortable to re-compile them every time and still not very good for that),
                    JS asynchronous execution is somehow confusing, but it is important for browsers, 
                    because the web page is still responsive while executing I/O operations, 
                    and in Node.js it helps to accelerate apps, which use a lot of I/O operations 
                    (which is common for web applications). PHP was really popular at that time 
                    (there was definetly no PHP 7), but I did not like it.
